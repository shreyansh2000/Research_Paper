Summary:
Our research proposes a novel approach for diagnosing schizophrenia using machine learning techniques.
Schizophrenia diagnosis is often time-consuming and prone to errors.
We address this challenge by leveraging high-dimensional imaging data and analyzing diverse symptoms associated with the disorder.
Our method assigns weights to these symptoms based on cross-correlations and uses machine learning classifiers to predict the probability of schizophrenia in individuals. 
Our study demonstrates that Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers outperform other methods, achieving a remarkable accuracy of 76% in distinguishing patients from healthy controls.
This approach shows promise in improving the efficiency and accuracy of schizophrenia diagnosis, offering a valuable contribution to the field of neuroscience.
